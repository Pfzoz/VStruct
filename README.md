# VStruct
VStruct is a personal quickly-made program and object created with the purpose of facilitating project organization within VHDL projects.

For now, VStruct.run() does not completely integrates itself with VStruct.analyze() + tmp functionality. Overall tmp is for now only details and not completely functional.
Enabling tmp is not recommended overall.
VStruct.run() also runs .analyze() itself, being completly dependent on it.

VStruct is also completely dependent on commands from the open-source analyzer, compiler and simulator GHDL, which can be found here https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl
